iphonedev
=========

contains iphone/ipad apps that I am working on

BracketCam
==========
very simple custom camera app that will allow user to set "bracketing" - technique that allows photographer take several picture at different exposures: underexposed, normal and overexposed. I plan to allow 3 or 5 shutter stops, as well as 1/2 and 1 step increments

MotoGear
========
allows motorcycle riders calculate % speed offset from their stock gearing. If the defualt gearing is changed, the speedometer is no longer a reliable source for current speed. Given the decrease/increase in sprocket size, app will calcuate how much speedometer has to be adjusted [based on make/model/year of the motorcycle]
